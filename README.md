## Installation and Setup Instructions

Clone down this repository. Tested on `Windows 10`. Setup instructions will be for `Windows 10`

Has been compiled to `windows-amd64/tnt_run.exe` but requires Java
Alternatively can be run/re-compiled using Processing 4 (recommended)


#### Game

Objective is to avoid tiles which have already been run over. User has ability to jump, making the invlunerable for a period (dictated by the map) , however having their acceleration reduced by a factor as well. First player to re-touch a tile loses and the lifetime counter is updated. Maps provide variations in friction, jump duration, and acceleration.
